## THE PROBLEM
Can `gsap` be used within a modern React.js project?

## THE SOLUTION
After some research, I have been able to import the `gsap` npm package, and implement it in this React.js-based project test.

** **

## FEATURES

* Front Page
  * A beautiful 3-stage animation triggered by a user's scroll
    * Clip-Path Circle enlarges to reveal a video background while the centered Pursuit Logo shrinks and disappears
    * Page title fades in
    * Page sub-title fades in
* Second Page
  * Archive of Jordan Manley's Advanced DSA classwork
    * For this test, this will be represented with just 2 class containers as a proof of concept

## FUTURE FEATURES

* Create components for Class-Containers and other reusable elements
* Implement testing
* Update CSS to SCSS/SASS

## TECHNICAL MILESTONES

* Using `gsap` to implement a timeline with a ScrollTrigger
* Hosting `.mp4` video in the public folder
* Adjusting the duration of animated elements within the `gsap` timeline

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

* **React.js** For the front-end/client interface of this app
* **gsap** Javascript toolset for implementing CSS animations
* **JavaScript**
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **SASS** Currently unused, but incorporated to check for unexpected conflicts with `gsap`

## LOCAL SETUP

**NOTE: You must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) in your computer for this to run.**

You can check to see if you already have Node.js by typing `node -v` in your terminal. If your shell/terminal doesn't complain and you see version numbers you are good to go.

1. Clone this repo into a folder of your choice:

       `git clone https://github.com/DouglasMacKrell/gsap-test.git`

2. Install dependencies:

       `npm install`

3. To launch the React App, enter:

       `npm start`

4. A new browser tab should have been opened and the App should be running. If that is not the case check the terminals output for errors, if you are unable to troubleshoot the problem, I would be happy to address issues so open [one](/issues)
